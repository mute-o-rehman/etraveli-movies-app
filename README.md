### Overview:

The Etraveli Movies React App assignment involves the creation of a web application that displays information about movies. The app is built using React, Redux for state management, and Jest for testing.

### Project Structure:

The project structure adheres to common React project conventions. Key components include:

### MovieList: Displays a list of movies, allowing users to select and view details for a specific movie.

### MovieDetail: Shows detailed information about the selected movie, including ratings and additional details fetched from an external API.

### MovieHeader: Provides sorting and filtering options for the movie list.

### Code Quality:

- Modular Components: Components are well-organized and modular, promoting code reusability.
- Redux Integration: Redux is effectively used for state management, providing a predictable state container.
- Async Operations: Async operations (e.g., fetching movie details) are handled gracefully using asynchronous actions.
- Error Handling: There are some areas where error handling can be improved, especially in async operations and API calls.

### Testing:

I have tested the app manually. Due to shortage of time unable to implement the jest. But i have basic understanding how to use jest in project.

### Conclusion:

The assignment demonstrates a solid understanding of React, Redux, and asynchronous operations. The modular structure and use of state management contribute to maintainable and scalable code.

Overall, the assignment is well-structured, and with the suggested improvements, it has the potential to be a functional and polished Etraveli Movies React App.
